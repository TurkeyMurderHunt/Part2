		The messages seem to have dropped off from here...but we have spotted him moving about in Brooklyn.
		<br/><br/>On Monday, he was seen walking to the following places:
		<br/>He grabbed some lunch at <i>Sushi Tatsu</i>,
		<br/>He then went to <i>Access Hardware</i> and got some tools,
		<br/>After that, he stopped by <i>Gueros Brooklyn</i> and picked up some tacos,
		<br/>and seemingly that wasn't enough for him because he went to <i>The Crabby Shack</i> also.

		<br/><br/>
		On Tuesday, he was seen standing at <i>942 Sterling Pl</i>. talking with some hooded man,
		<br/>He then went to <i>Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation</i>. Reasons unknown.
		<br/>He also met up with another man at <i>Saint Gregory RC Church</i>,
		<br/>and maybe he was feeling a little religious that day because he ended the day going to <i>Trinity Baptist Church</i>.


		<br/><br/>
		Later that week, he was seen dining at <i>Best Hamburgers & Deli</i>,
		<br/>Picked up some Korean food at <i>Kimchi Grill</i>,
		<br/>Found some interesting Boutiques at <i>Gureje Inc</i>
		<br/>and also went to the <i>Academy for Health Careers</i>.
