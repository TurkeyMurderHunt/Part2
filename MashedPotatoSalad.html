<br/>He grabbed some lunch at <i>Sushi Tatsu</i>,
<br/>He then went to <i>Access Hardware</i> and got some tools,

<br/>and seemingly that wasn't enough for him because he went to <i>The Crabby Shack</i> also.

On Tuesday, he was seen standing at <i>942 Sterling Pl.</i> talking with some hooded man,
<br/>He then went to <i>FJC Security Services</i>.  Reasons unknown.
